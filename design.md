Design overlay:

    Add more buttons/radio/select or input field?
    Line heigh: 1,5.
    fix padding and margin.
    Accessability.
    Work on width/height.

    add icons for left & right button to
    navigate through images rather than
    using a "randomizer"
    but instead, a fixed array that is
    looped through.
